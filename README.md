# Radcoin

Radcoin is a cryptocurrency designed to make money virtual. 

How will this happen?

1) Radcoin is built using the best cryptographic algorithms for hashing, signing, and encrypting, and these algorithms will be continually upgraded.

2) The total number of coins in the pool is indeterminate so that mining operations can continue indefinitely or end when valuation is at optimal levels

3) The end date is also indeterminate and will be set accordingly based on optimal market conditions

Radcoin is just the beginning. The goal is to deploy a crypto coin for every human on earth (7.2 billion) and allow them to compete. 
Eventually, someone people will get very wealthy, and thus make money virtual.
